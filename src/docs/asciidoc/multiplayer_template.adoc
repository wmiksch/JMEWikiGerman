This page is to make your own multiplayer game, mainly by using a template and understanding how it works.

The template for a multiplayer project can be found here:

  private SimpleApplication App;  we need this to get the rootnode
  private BulletAppState bulletAppState; allows using bullet physics in an Application. 
  private Node rootNode;   the node which gets all the nodes (add to this one, and it'll be visible)
  private AnimChannel animChannel; used to change the current anitmation
  private AnimControl animControl;   this is needed to create an animchannel
  private BitmapText label;     label where we add a the textnode to
