Filters are used for scene-wide effects such as glow, fog, blur. The SDK lets you create a file storing combinations of filters. You can preview the filter settings on a loaded scene in the SDK. You can load them into your application (add them to the viewPort) to activate your preconfigured set of several filters in one step.

== Loading filters in a game

To load a filter in a game (that is, to add it to your game's viewport), add the following lines to your game's simpleInit() method (or some other place):

[source,java]
----
FilterPostProcessor processor = (FilterPostProcessor) assetManager.loadAsset("Filters/MyFilter.j3f");
viewPort.addProcessor(processor);
----
