There are a plethora of ways to create skymaps with varying levels of difficulty and expense. The link:http://planetside.co.uk/[Terragen] program has been mentioned as one way to do so but it is now limited in its use and for commercial purposes is not free. Another program, link:https://www.daz3d.com/bryce-7-pro[Bryce], is also not free and seems to of stalled in development based off there only being a 32bit version available. Maybe they are doing things behind the scenes but its still not a free program. This articles intent is to give the JME3 user other options for the creation of skymaps using the free programs Blender and Gimp. It is not the be all, end all of skymap creation. If you know of better methods or tools please feel free to share your wisdom on the link:https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/[forums].


== Blender


Using Blender you can create your skymaps for free. Once link:https://www.blender.org/[Blender] is setup, your skymaps creation can be done easily. For this article I will go into detail on how to setup Blender to create Angular maps based off a video produced by jMonkey contributor glaucomardano and mentioned in this link:https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/jmonkeyengine-tutorial-how-to-create-skymaps-using-blender/19313[forum post]. Contributor glaucomardano did a good job on the video but it requires previous knowledge of Blender to be able to easily follow along. As such, I will translate it to paper for you. You can view his video by following this link: link:https://youtu.be/z38Aikz5nE8[jMonkeyEngine Tutorial - How to create skymaps using blender].

[NOTE]

.Blender Skybox Checklist
- [ ] Start with a new file in blender.
- [ ] Select the lamp and the default cube in the 3d view or in the Outliner panel (top-right panel) and delete them: kbd:[X]. They are not needed for this procedure.
- [ ] Select the camera object in the 3d view or in the Outliner panel then clear its location and rotation by using keyboard shortcuts kbd:[Alt]+kbd:[G] and kbd:[Alt]+kbd:[R].
- [ ] In the properties panel (lower-right panel) select the Object tab (orange box). This will give you a visual perspective of the camera changes you are about to make.
- [ ] Rename the Camera to Camera-north.
- [ ] With your cursor inside the 3d view, change to top-ortho view by pressing kbd:[NumPad 7] followed by kbd:[NumPad 5].
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[R] immediately followed by kbd:[X] immediately followed by 90 immediately followed by kbd:[Enter] to rotate the camera 90 degrees around the X axis.
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[D]. This will duplicate the camera. Next press kbd:[Enter] to set the selection.
- [ ] Press kbd:[R] immediately followed by 180 immediately followed by kbd:[Enter]. This will rotate the camera 180 degrees around the Z axis. Rename this camera to Camera-south.
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[D]. This will duplicate the camera. Next press kbd:[Enter] to set the selection.
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[R] immediately followed by 90 immediately followed by kbd:[Enter]. This will rotate the camera another 90 degrees around the Z axis. Rename this camera to Camera-west.
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[D]. This will duplicate the camera. Next press kbd:[Enter] to set the selection.   
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[R] immediately followed by -180 immediately followed by kbd:[Enter]. This will rotate the camera -180 degrees around the Z axis. Rename this camera to Camera-east.
- [ ] With your mouse inside the 3d view change your view to right-ortho by entering kbd:[NumPad 3].
- [ ] Select Camera-south in 3d view or in the Outliner panel (top-right panel) and press kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[D]. This will duplicate the camera. Next press kbd:[Enter] to set the selection.
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[R] immediately followed by 90 immediately followed by kbd:[Enter]. This will rotate the camera 90 degrees around the X axis. The camera should now be pointing up. Rename this camera to Camera-up.
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[D]. This will duplicate the camera. Next press kbd:[Enter] to set the selection.
- [ ] With the camera still selected, press kbd:[R] immediately followed by 180 immediately followed by kbd:[Enter]. This will rotate the camera 180 degrees along the X axis. The camera should now be facing down. Rename this camera to Camera-down.
- [ ] Save your file.

.Angular Map
- [ ] Open up a web browser and search for "free high res skymap" and select a Angular map of your choice or you can find some here at link:https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?24038-Free-high-res-skymaps-%2528Massive-07-update!%2529[https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?24038-Free-high-res-skymaps-%2528Massive-07-update!%2529] instead. Remember to select an *ANGULAR* map.
- [ ] Save a map to your pc in a place you can easily locate it from later in blender.

[%interactive]
.Textures Tab
- [ ] From the properties panel (bottom-right panel) select the Textures tab (red-white checkerboard) then press the new button to create a new texture. Rename this texture to AngMap.
- [ ] Under the Image panel select open and navigate to the file you saved earlier.
- [ ] In the Mapping panel select AngMap from the drop down box.
- [ ] In the Influence panel de-select blend (ble) and select horizon (hor).

[%interactive]
.Data Tab
- [ ] From the properties panel select the Data tab (reel to reel camera).
- [ ] In the lens panel change the Focal Lens value from 35 to 16. Do this for every camera.

[%interactive]
.Render Tab
- [ ] From the properties panel select the Render tab (normal looking camera).
- [ ] In the Dimensions panel set the resolution to any number that is a power of 2. For this example 1024 x 1024. 
- [ ] Slide the resolution scale to 100%.
- [ ] In the Output panel change the image type to JPEG. I have found out by trial and error that using a JPEG file has the same image quality as a PNG or DDS file but with a huge difference in image size. A single PNG image will clock in at over 8mb to the JPEG size of 325kb. Even converting to a DDS file comes in at over 3mb for comparison (using RGB888 as is recommended by Momoko_Fan/Core Developer in this link:https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/best-dds-format-for-skyfactory/17668/2[forum post]) with no gain in image quality that I could see. Your welcome to experiment on your own if you wish.
- [ ] Set the image format to RGB.
- [ ] Setting the quality slider has the effect of reducing the image size where 0 is maximum compression and 100 is no compression. In this example, setting it to 0 reduced the image sizes to less than 125kb, once again with no discernable image degradation that I could see.

.World Tab
- [ ] In the properties panel select the World tab.
- [ ] Check the Real Sky toggle.

[%interactive]
.Map Generator Setup 
- [ ] From the header at the top of the 3d view click the btn:[Choose Screen Layout] button next to the word `Default` and select `Split Verticle F/R`. 
- [ ] Click the `+` sign to create a new layout. 
- [ ] Rename this new layout Angular Map Generator or a name of your choosing.
- [ ] In the left side 3d view, at the bottom, next to the word view, is the btn:[Current Editor Type] button. Click it and change it to `UV/Image Editor`.
- [ ] Place your mouse inside the right side 3d view and press kbd:[NumPad 5] to toggle ortho view. You're now setup to render your Angular map.
- [ ] Save your file.

[%interactive]
.Rendering And Saving
- [ ] With your first camera selected (in this case Camera-down) and your mouse inside the right side 3d view, press kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[NumPad 0] to set your selected camera to be the active camera. 
- [ ] Press kbd:[F12] to render the scene. A image will appear in the left side UV/Image Editor.
- [ ] With your mouse inside the left side UV/Image Editor you can scroll in or out to center the view.
- [ ] With your mouse inside the left side UV/Image Editor press kbd:[F3] to save your image. Rename the image (down.jpg in this case). 

Follow this same procedure for the remaining cameras. Rendering, renaming and saving each. After you have rendered all your images you can copy and paste them into your asset folder for JME3. Usually under the `Assets/Texture` directory. 

To use your images in your code, in simpleInitApp(), load the Textures and use the SkyFactory to create your sky.

[source,java]
----
Texture west = getAssetManager().loadTexture("Textures/Sky/west.jpg");
Texture east = getAssetManager().loadTexture("Textures/Sky/east.jpg");
Texture north = getAssetManager().loadTexture("Textures/Sky/north.jpg");
Texture south = getAssetManager().loadTexture("Textures/Sky/south.jpg");
Texture up = getAssetManager().loadTexture("Textures/Sky/up.jpg");
Texture down = getAssetManager().loadTexture("Textures/Sky/down.jpg");
getRootNode().attachChild(SkyFactory.createSky(getAssetManager(), west, east, north, south, up, down));

== Gimp


You can use link:https://www.gimp.org/[Gimp] to create SkyMaps from a single image with the addition of 2 scripts.

*  link:https://code.google.com/archive/p/gimp-dds/[Gimp-dds]
*  link:http://registry.gimp.org/node/25532[Cubemap Layers Generator]

After installing the scripts you open a image in gimp. This script works by slicing up the image into 6 layers of equal size, each by the power of 2. 

.  After you open the image you select `menu:Filters[Generic > Cubemap Layers Generator]`.
.  Fill in the details as follows. 
**  Source: navigate to the image you are slicing.
**  Cubemap layout: `Cross Horizontal`
**  2 to the power of: `10` (for 1024 sized Layers) 
.  Press btn:[OK] to slice up the image.
.  Select `menu:File[Export As]` and change the `Name` and `File Type` to `.dds`. Choose your save location, typically `Assets/Textures`.
.  Press btn:[Export].
. A DDS panel will open. Apply the following settings:
* Compression: `None`
* Format: `RGB8`
* Save: `As cube map`
* MipMaps: `No mipmaps`
. Press btn:[OK] to export.

You attach the exported image to your scene as is explained in the <<jme3/advanced/sky#,How to add a Sky to your Scene>> tutorial.
