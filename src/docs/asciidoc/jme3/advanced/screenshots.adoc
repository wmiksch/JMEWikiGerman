The com.jme3.app.state.ScreenshotAppState enables your users to take screenshots of the running game.

You activate this feature as follows in your simpleInitApp() method:

[source,java]
----

ScreenshotAppState screenShotState = new ScreenshotAppState();
this.stateManager.attach(screenShotState);

----

The default screenshot key is KeyInput.KEY_SYSRQ, alos known as â€œSystem Request / Print Screen key. On Mac keyboards, this key does not exist, so on Mac +++<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>+++ you take screenshots using Command+Shift+3 (fullscreen) or Command+Shift+4 (windowed: press space to select a window and then click).

The screenshot is saved to the user directory.
