You may want your players to press a button to save a game, you want a scrolling text field for highscores, a text label to display the score, drop-downs to select keymap preferences, or checkboxes to specify multi-media options. Usually you solve these tasks by using Swing controls. Although it is possible to embed a <<jme3/advanced/swing_canvas#,jME3 canvas>> in a Swing +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++, a 3D game typically runs full-screen, or in a window of its own.

This document introduces you to link:https://github.com/nifty-gui/nifty-gui/[Nifty GUI], a Java library for building interactive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for games or similar applications. Nifty +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++ (the `de.lessvoid.nifty` package) is well integrated with jME3 through the `com.jme3.niftygui` package. You define the base +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++ layout in XML, and control it dynamically from your Java code. The necessary JAR libraries are included in your jME3 download, you do not need to install anything extra. (Just make sure they are on the classpath.)

== Tutorial Overview

Learn to add a Nifty +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++ to your jME3 game by going through this multi-part tutorial:

.  Understand the Nifty GUI Concepts described on this page.
.  <<jme3/advanced/nifty_gui_best_practices#,Browse this short list of Best Practices>>
.  Lay out your graphical user interface:
**  <<jme3/advanced/nifty_gui_xml_layout#,Lay out the GUI in XML>> – or –
**  <<jme3/advanced/nifty_gui_java_layout#,Lay out the GUI in Java>>

.  Integrate the +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++ into the game:
**  <<jme3/advanced/nifty_gui_overlay#,Overlay the User Interface Over the Screen>>  – or –
**  <<jme3/advanced/nifty_gui_projection#,Project the User Interface Onto a Texture>>

== Must Know: Nifty GUI Concepts

image:jme3/advanced/nifty-screen-layer-panel.png[nifty-screen-layer-panel.png,width="",height=""]

Nifty GUIs are made up of the following *elements*:

*  A Nifty +++<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>+++ contains one or more *screens*.
**  Only one screen is visible at a time.
**  Name the first screen `start`. Name any others whatever you like.
**  Screen are <<jme3/advanced/nifty_gui_java_interaction#,controlled by a Java Controller class>>.

*  A screen contains one or more *layers*.
**  Layers are containers that impose alignment on their contents (vertical, horizontal, or centered)
**  Layers can overlap (z-order), and cannot be nested.

*  A layer contains *panels*.
**  Panels are containers that impose alignment on their contents (vertical, horizontal, or centered)
**  Panels can be nested, and cannot overlap.

*  A panel contains *images, text, or controls (buttons, etc)*.

== Nifty Logging (Nifty 1.4.2)

If you want to disable the nifty log lines, add this code after you created nifty:

[source]
----

Logger.getLogger("de.lessvoid.nifty").setLevel(Level.SEVERE);
Logger.getLogger("NiftyInputEventHandlingLog").setLevel(Level.SEVERE);

----
