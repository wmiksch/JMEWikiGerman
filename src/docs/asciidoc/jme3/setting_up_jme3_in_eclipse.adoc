For development with the jMonkeyEngine 3, we recommend to use the jMonkeyEngine SDK.

Alternatively, you can use your favorite IDE: In this tutorial we show how to download and set up the latest nightly build of the jMonkeyEngine 3 for use with the Eclipse IDE. Instructions for <<jme3/setting_up_netbeans_and_jme3#,NetBeans IDE>> are also available.


== Downloading jME3

The currently available JAR binaries are the nightly builds.

.  Download the most recent zipped build from link:https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases[https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases]
.  Unzip the file and save it as `jME3.2-stable` in your home directory ($HOME). You should see the following files and directories:
**  `lib/` – The jMonkeyEngine binaries, and libraries used by the jMonkeyEngine. (Don't remove)
**  `jMonkeyEngine3.jar` – Run this to see various feature demos. (optional)
**  `javadoc/` – jME3 +++<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>+++ documentation. (optional)



== Creating a New Game Project

*  In Eclipse, choose `menu:File[New>Java Project]`
*  Project Name: `HelloJME3`
*  Click btn:[Finish]

The new project appears in the Explorer.


== Setting up Dependencies

Your project depends on the jMonkeyEngine libraries and needs to know where they are.

.  Right-click the project in the explorer and choose `menu:Build Path[Add External Archives]`
.  In the "`JAR`" selection dialog, browse to the `$HOME/jME3.2-stable` directory.
.  Select all JARs in the `lib` directory and click Open.

All necessary JAR libraries are now on the classpath and should appear in the Referenced Libraries list. For a detailed description of the separate jar files see <<jme3/jme3_source_structure#structure_of_jmonkeyengine3_jars,this list>>.


== Setting up Assets

The easiest way to make sure the asset manager can access the assets is by adding the assets folder to the classpath.

.  Go to `Project Properties`
.  Select `Java Build Path`
.  Under the `Source` tab click btn:[Add Folder]
.  Add your Assets folder


== Writing a Simple Application

.  From the menu call `menu:File[New>New Package]`. Name the src package for example `hello`.
.  From the menu call `menu:File[New>Class]`.
**  Select package `hello`.
**  Name the class for example `MyGame`.
**  Superclass: `com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication`
**  Make sure that the checkbox to `Create the main() Method` is active.
**  Make sure that the checkbox to `Inheriting Abstract Methods` is active.
**  Click btn:[Finish].


You can now continue to write <<jme3/beginner/hello_simpleapplication#,your first jme3 application>>!
