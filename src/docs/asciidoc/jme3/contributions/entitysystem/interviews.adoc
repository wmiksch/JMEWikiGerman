== ES Approaches

Entity System implementations are various! 

As said, we are talking about Component oriented programming Entity System, implemented in Object oriented programming language and enviroment like Java!

So,we are

*  *not talking* about Groovy, Scala, Closure.. or any Java extension!
*  *not talking* about Entity system in any scope other than in a real-time application!
*  *focusing* in 'core' features, which exclude many specific usecases
*  *trying* to be unprejudiced , impersonal to make equitable judge.


=== Outline

.  Initial philosophy
.  Pure data or not?
.  Multi-threading, concurency enable or not?
.  Communication: Event messaging enable or not?
.  Is database (and other kind of persistent) friendly or not?
.  Is enterprise friendly (expanable/ extensible/ modulizable) or not?
.  Script possibilities?
.  Restrictions and limitation
.  Dependencies
.  Current status: Long term, stable, community?

The comparasions will focus in these below points, follow with the scope, status of each projects
Detail explanation of abbove points <<jme3/contributions/entitysystem/points#,points>>


== ES projects interviews

These interviews are short but focus dicussion to help you get a clear view of underlying implementation of each project.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Review: HERE! <<jme3/contributions/entitysystem/interviews/artemis#,artemis>> because I can not contact with author of Artemis at the moment so I will have a short review of it with some of my experience working on it and base on its source code!
====



==== Short conclusion

Artemis approach

.  Initial philosophy : Lightweight, small footprint and 1.5+
.  Pure data: No
.  Multi-threading, concurency: with care
.  Communication: Event messaging enable or not? No implementation yet
.  Is database (and other kind of persistent) friendly or not? No implementation yet
.  Is enterprise friendly (expanable/ extensible/ modulizable) or not? Not clear but because not pure data, consider Yes
.  Script possibilities? Yes
.  Restrictions and limitation: Custom System has to be extends base System; Processor base; Aspect base, Has documented about Dependencies between System
.  External library dependencies : No
.  Current status: Long term, stable, community? The most early Java ES, more than 3 years, kind of unactive, has a forum.

Interview: <<jme3/contributions/entitysystem/interviews/zay-es#,zay-es>>

[IMPORTANT]
====
In my POV, Zay-ES has the most active development status and also the maintainer is a core JME3 dev, that's why all its functions and wisdoms are close to JME3!
====



==== Short conclusion

Zay-ES approach

.  Initial philosophy : Lightweight, small footprint and 1.5+
.  Pure data: Yes
.  Multi-threading, concurency: free, by design, but still _need better design contract_
.  Communication: Event messaging enable or not? No implementation yet
.  Is database (and other kind of persistent) friendly or not? No implementation yet
.  Is enterprise friendly (expanable/ extensible/ modulizable) or not? Not clear, _lack of design contract_
.  Script possibilities? Yes
.  Restrictions and limitation: Free of System implementation, but _lack of design contract_
.  External library dependencies : No
.  Current status: Long term, stable, community? more than 2 years, open source recently, active, has a forum in Jmonkey's hub.
