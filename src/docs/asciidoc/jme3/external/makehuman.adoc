Here's the procedure:

.  If you haven't already, install the jMonkeyEngine3 SDK, launch the IDE, and create a JME3 project.
.  Install the MakeHuman application, the Blender application, and the MakeHuman Blender tools.
**  Download the latest stable version of the MakeHuman application from link:http://www.makehuman.org/[http://www.makehuman.org/]
**  Download the latest stable MakeHuman Blender tools from link:http://www.makehuman.org/[http://www.makehuman.org/]
**  Download the corresponding (not necessarily the latest) version of the Blender application from link:http://www.blender.org/[http://www.blender.org/]
**  Install the MakeHuman application as directed by link:http://www.makehuman.org/doc/node/install_makehuman.html[http://www.makehuman.org/doc/node/install_makehuman.html]
**  Install the Blender application.
**  Install the MakeHuman tool scripts to Blender's scripts directory.  On Windows 7 machines, this involves unzipping the archive to `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\version\scripts\addons`
**  Launch the Blender application, open a `User Preferences` editor, activate the `Addons` tab, and check the box labelled `Import-Export:Import:MakeHuman(.mhx)`.
**  Click the `Save User Preferences` button.

.  Generate an .mhx file containing a human figure.
**  Launch the MakeHuman application.
**  Configure a human figure using the `Modelling`, `Geometries`, and `Materials` tabs.
**  On the `Pose/Animate` tab, select a rig for animation if desired.
**  Under the `Files` tab, select the `Save` sub-tab.
**  Save to a file (in case you need to make changes later).  Note that there are two `Save` buttons: one in the `Save As` window which merely sets a pathname and another in the main window.  The .mhm file isn't written until you click the second `Save` button.
**  Under the `Files` tab, select the `Export` sub-tab.
**  Select `Blender exchange (mhx)` as the export format.
**  Export to a file.  Again, there's a `Save` button in the Save As window which merely sets a pathname.  The .mhx file isn't written until you click the `Export` button in the main window.
**  You may now close the MakeHuman application.

.  Convert the .mhx file to a .blend file:
**  Launch the Blender application and delete the initial cube.
**  From the `Info` editor's toolbar, select `menu:File[Import>MakeHuman(.mhx)]`.
**  In the `File Browser`, select your .mhx file and click the `Import MHX` button.
**  After the import completes, you can view and edit the model using a `3D View` editor.
**  From the `Info` editor's toolbar, select `menu:File[Save As]`.
**  Select a pathname in the assets/Models folder of your JME3 project.
**  Clicking the `Save As Blender File` button in the `File Browser` writes the file.
**  You may now close the Blender application.

.  Convert the .blend file to a .j3o file no longer works, instead, export the file using a <<jme3/features#supported-external-file-types,Supported External File Type>>:
**  Launch the jMonkeyEngine3 IDE.
**  Open your JME3 project.
**  Under the `Project Assets` node of your project, open the `Models` folder.
**  Right-click on your exported file type and select `Convert to j3o binary`.
