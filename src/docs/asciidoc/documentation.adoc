This documentation wiki contains installation and configuration guides, jME coding tutorials and other information that will help you get your game project going. You can search the contents of this wiki using the "`Wiki`" menu search box at the top of each page.

You are also very welcome to fix mistakes or spelling as well as unclear paragraphs using the "`Wiki`" menu "`Edit`" icon:pencil-square[role="blue"] and "`Add`" icon:plus-square[role="blue"] buttons. You have to be logged into GitHub to edit the wiki. You can learn more about editing and contributing under the <<documentation#contribute#,Contribute>> heading.

TIP: This is an Admonition. You will see many of these scattered throughout the Wiki. See the <<wiki/admonitions#,Admonition Definitions>> for the meaning of this and all the other Admonitions.

== Forum

The link:http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/[forum] is your first stop when reporting bugs, making contributions, discussing wiki content, or anything else that you can't get the answer for by reading the wiki or searching the forum archives. You will find it to be a friendly and inviting place to have discussions, but before posting, there are two minor rules you will need to observe.

.  For questions that include code, learn link:https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/how-to-type-code-blocks/31155[how to use code blocks]. If you fail to do so, you will at best be reminded of your lapse in judgment and may not receive an answer to your question at all otherwise. See the <<github_tips#,Github Tips>> page for info on how to insert links into your posts.

pass:[*] The SDK creates Ant-based projects that any Java IDE can import. We recommend users of other IDEs to also download the jMonkeyEngine SDK and choose `menu:File[Import Project > External Project Assets]` to create a codeless project for managing assets only. This way you can code in the IDE of your choice, and use the SDK to convert your models to .j3o format.


== Create

After downloading and installing, <<jme3#,bookmark the jME Documentation page>> and start writing your first game!
